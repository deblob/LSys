# LSys
 A little test which can draw simple Lindenmayer systems.
 Completely based on [this article](http://www.fraktalwelt.de/lsys/seite16.html) by Peter Jossen and Daniel Eyer.
 The syntax for the axiom and replacement rules is directly lifted of the article too. Only one letter is supported in formulas for now.
